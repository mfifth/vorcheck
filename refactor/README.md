## Refactor and Improve
There are two files, `refactor/lib/order_summary.rb` and
`refactor/spec/order_summary_spec.rb`. Please adjust them as described
below.

### Refactor

  - Refactor `OrderSummary` and `Product` so that they adhear to
    commonaly accepted Ruby coding standards and best practices.

### Improve

  - Some products are tax exempt and as such we shouldn't calculate
    tax for those items.
  - Identify any deficencies with the logic and provide reasonable
    solutions
