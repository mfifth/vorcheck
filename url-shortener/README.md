### Rails

**Language: Rails (i.e., Ruby)**

In the `url-shortener` directory, write Rails code that could be used in a
application that does url shortening.

There are two files in this directory to get started. You can start by putting
code into those files. Feel free to create additional files if you want.

  - The application creates _short_ URLs for any given long URL.
    - Given "https://www.example.com/some-long-url" we will get
      back a short URL like "https://lend.to/xxx"
    - Visiting the short URL redirects us to the longer URL.
    - The application tracks how often a short URL is used.

The point of this exercise is to start a conversation about coding in Rails.
Think about where you put code, how it might be re-used elsewhere, and just
overall design of a "real application."
