# VorCheck

This repo is the basis for our engineering quiz, which is part of our standard
interview process. It's important to understand that we don't use programming
excercises as a discrete _pass_ or _fail_ tool. We use these excercises as a
starting point for coding-focused conversations. These conversations help us
better understand a potential candidate's skill levels.

## How to Use

  1. Checkout this repo (you can fork it if you prefer)
  1. Focus on at-most three of the excercises (see below)
  1. Work on it for about an hour (a little more-or-less is fine
  as we aren't tracking time, we just don't feel it's necessary
  to work on it any longer than an hour)
  1. When you are finished, provide us with a copy of your
  work at least **2 hours** prior to your scheduled interview. The code can be a patch-file, a zip file or a pull-request.
  
## Excercises

There are empty directories in this repo, and work should be done
entirely within them. This is just to keep everything in one place.

Each of the sub-directories here contains a single excercise. See the README in
each of those sub-directories for further instructions.

You should focus on no more than **three** of the excercises. Some of the
excercises are focused more on _front-end_ and some more towards _back-end_
skills. You should choose to work on excercises that best reflect the position
you are applying for.
